# ipython - a better command shell

This talk is an introduction to `ipython`, which is a much nicer command shell than the default python shell.

## Getting to the `ipython` shell

You have a few options:

1. The no install way: Click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/christine-e-smit/python-community/ipython?filepath=ipython). Once the interface finishes loading, click on New -> Terminal. Once the terminal comes up, type `ipython`.

2. The slightly harder way: install anaconda python, a python distribution that comes with ipython included. <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>. Once anaconda is installed and in your path, type `ipython`.

3. The hard core way: install ipython in your current python distribution. Generally, this will be `pip install ipython`. Once installed, type `ipython`.
